<h2>What is Social Engineering?</h2>
<p>Social engineering is a tactic that people use to obtain unauthorized information. This could be done with several different attacks, but the main goal is to try to get their target to trust them to be willing to give them their perrsonal information.</p>

<h2>Types of Social Engineering Attacks</h2>
<p>There are several types of social engineering attacks, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Phishing</li>
  <li>Baiting</li>
  <li>Pretexting</li>
  <li>Quid Pro Quo</li>
  <li>Tailgating</li>
  <li>Watering Hole</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples of Social Engineering Attacks</h2>
<p>Here are some examples of social engineering attacks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pretending to be a higher up person like a CEO or Director sending a phishing link to employees of the company to give them personal information.</li>
  <li>Getting someone to download hardware onto their devices which allows the attacker to get personal file from the device without them knowing.</li>
  <li>Calling somoneone pretneding to be their bank provider to resolve an issue and ask for personal information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Protect Yourself from Social Engineering Attacks</h2>
<p>Here are some tips for protecting yourself from social engineering attacks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be aware with phishing links through emails to get their victims to change their password, update some personal information, etc.</li>
  <li>Rejects any requests you have receive for technical support, personal bank accounts not having sufficient funds etc.</li>
  <li>Update devices that you use regularly that may contain personal data that could be vulnerable to attackers if software is not up to date.</li>
  <li>double checking to see if you're talk to the person they say they are. If you recieve a call fromone that clains they work at the bank you use. Give them a call yourself to make sure the issue is actually there or even better physcailly going to the bank.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Social engineering attacks are executed</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Attackers usually pretend to be someone that is high up in a company requesting for a password change, money for something, etc.</li>
  <li>Attackers also target people pretneding to be someone who works at a bank and requesting for money, personal information, etc.</li>
  <li>Another way is making their victim scare and how they need a certain sfotware in order to fix their issues or having to pay a small fee.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Does Social Engineering Work?</h2>
ÃŸ
<p>Social Engineering works well when the attackers build a trust with their victim. Using psyhcology attackers target their victims based on their feelings and needs.
  Some attackers use this technique to exploit their vicitims to feel a certain why such as pretending to be employee at a banking firm and conviencing them that their
  money is not in safe hands because of different security measures on the accounts which could lead to them sending a phisihing link to change their password where the
  attacker can get access to these information. Another reason why this technique works is attackers would make the victim feel like getting everything situated now is better
  often times victims would feel that it is time sensitive and if they don't get it done now the worst can happen. This leads to victims giving personal infromation to the 
  attackers without realizing until its too late </p>
  
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>Social Engineering is something that occurs everyday and we are unaware of it. Phone providers have been better with telling their users that a call could be a potential 
    spam call with caller ID, but this doesn't eliminate the risk of recieving a spam call believing it is real. As social engineering grows attackers are finding new ways to 
    gain the trust of their victims to send them personal information. There is no way to eliminate these kind of attacks but there are ways to prevent it from occuring to you. 
    Hopefully with the information I provided you will be more aware with social engineering attack and ways you can prevent it from happening to you and signs where the person 
    you are talking to may not be who they say they are. There will always be different techniques being used as attackers grow and learn from their mistakes, but getting the knowledge 
    will help and spreading the information to people you may know that could be vulnerable to these attacks.
